This document contains the supporting python scripts for the manuscript "The Influence of Variability in Lift, Drag, Protrusion, Friction Angle, Particle and Fluid Density on Incipient Sediment Motion" By S.A. Feehan, S.W. McCoy, J.S. Scheingross, and M.H. Gardner. Included are the codes to create figures 1 â€“ 5: the generation of force balance parameter (FBP) distributions, Monte Carlo simulations, informing covariance sensitivity, exploration of the influence of roughness layer (k_s) and vertical grain location on uncertainty estimates, estimation of power law coefficients given varying assumptions of the physical constraints, and matching of the predicted entrainment thresholds against flume and field data. This material is provided in individual python scripts along with data compilation for comparison

These codes were designed for the analysis presented in Feehan et. al. 202X, JGR-Earth Surface.  Alternate uses may require modification.

Codes were written by Scott Feehan and Scott McCoy. Questions can be directed to Scott Feehan (sfeehan@nevada.unr.edu).
